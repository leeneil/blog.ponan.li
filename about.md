## About Po-Nan Li

Born and raised in Taiwan, Po-Nan is currently PhD candidate at Electrical Engineering, Stanford University. He specializes C/C++ and Matlab programming for scientific computation and computational imaging. His research interests include X-ray and computational imaging, biological computation and machine learning. During 2016-2017, Po-Nan was Vice President of Stanford Taiwanese Student Association (STSA). He received his bachelor's and master's degrees from National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan in 2010 and 2012, respectively.
